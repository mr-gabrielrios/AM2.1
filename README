This is the README file for December 2009 MOM4p1 public release.


Where to start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A good place to start is the "doc" directory, where you
will find  "user" guides for the MOM.  

How to run the MOM4p1 tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are 5 types of test models provided for this release in the exp directory 
all using the GFDL shared infrastructure (FMS). Each type has a compile and a run script.

1. Solo     : stand alone MOM4p1 Ocean model.
2. Coupled  : MOM4p1 coupled with GFDL ice model  (besides null versions of atmosphere and land models).
3. EBM      : MOM4p1 coupled with GFDL ice and atmosphere energy balanced model 
4. ICCM     : MOM4p1 coupled with GFDL ice, land and atmosphere in low resolution setup.  
5  CM2.1p1  : GFDL CM2.1 model coupled with MOM4p1

To run Solo models:

         0. Ensure that you have the right environment variable for your platform
            in the file  bin/environs.YOUR_PLATFORM_ID  
            YOUR_PLATFORM_ID could be any string that identifies your platform. 
            The file bin/environs.YOUR_PLATFORM_ID gets sourced at the beginning of
            all compile and run scripts and is there to make sure all compile and 
            run time library paths are found.
  
	 1. cd to exp and run mom4p1_solo_compile.csh first.
	 
         2. Modify the 'name' variable in the script 
            mom4p1_solo_run.csh to be the name of the test you 
            want to run. A list of available tests is included in the script.
            Also make sure you have a large enough working directory and
            made a symbolic link to it called "work" in your top directory. I.e.,
            > cd mom4p1_pubrel_dec2009
            > ln -s YOUR_LARGE_WORK_DIR work
            
         3. Get the required input data for the test from GFDL ftp site.
            You can get the info by running the script mom4p1_solo_run.csh
            and following the instructions.
	 
	 4. Run mom4p1_solo_run.csh
         
         5. The results go into "work"
         
To run all other models foo:
         Do the same steps above to foo_compile.csh and  foo_run.csh



Note:    The scripts have been tested fully only with Intel Fortran compiler on ia64 platform 
         and partly with pgi and pathscale compilers on x86_64 and 
         also gfortran4.3 compiler on Core2Duo processor. 

Note:    Some of these tests require a large disk space to save the input data.
         Choose a partition with enough space (1-2 G) to untar the code and data bundels.

Note:    If you want to use the same root directory for all three experiments we suggest to
         compile in the order of increasing complexity: solo -> coupled -> ebm .
         You may have to remove some of the existing .o and .mod files
         if you want to compile ebm experiment after the coupled experiment.
         E.g., you probably have to:   cd ../exec; rm mpp*.o mpp*.mod fms_io*.o fms_io*.mod 

Note:    IBM platform users might want to add the following line to the top of the run scripts 
             setenv LDR_CNTRL MAXDATA=0xD0000000@DSA 


Note:    The compile scripts provide the basic capability to use static memory allocation 
         which might be faster on some platforms. In that case you need to adjust the values
         of domain bounds properly according to the number of processors and layout. 

Note:    The compile scripts use netcdf3 by default. 
         If you want to use netcdf4 libraries instead you can do so by deleting the "-Duse_netCDF3"
         from the CPPs in compile scripts and then recompile.  Also, to make mppnccombine work with
         netcdf4 make sure to pass the -Duse_netCDF4 to the C compiler.
